# Liberty Web Docs
Welcome to the LibertyBans Web Interface Documentation.

## Installation Guide
1. Download the latest version of Liberty Web [here](https://github.com/Dimitri-Bit/Liberty-Bans-Web/releases)
2. Create a new folder in which you will run your Liberty Web server (If you are using a shared hosting panel such as Pterodactyl simply upload the jar to your server)
3. Copy your LibertyBans plugin folder and place it in the same directory as your Liberty Web jar (the plugin folder should be configured with the external database connection credentials)
