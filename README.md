# Liberty-Bans-Web
Web interface for the LibertyBans Minecraft Java edition plugin

This is currently a work in progress. The first release should be in a few days.

(Update: The release might be a bit late since I'm busy with a commission and studies but I'll do my best to release it in the next week)
